Data Visualization with graph and chars (Reports and Dashboard) by using Tableau

KPI Requirments-

*Total Vehicles-
-Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicle, encampassing both BEV and PHEV to access the market size and growth.

*Average Electric Range-
-Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset.

*Total BEV Vehicles and % of total BEV Vehicles-
-Identify and Analyse the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles(BEV) in the dataset.
-calculate the percentage of BEV relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into 
the dominance of fully electric models.

*Total PHEV Vehicles and % of total PHEV Vehicles-
-Identify and Analyse the total number of Pluge-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles(PHEV) in the dataset.
-calculate the percentage of PHEV relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into 
the dominance of fully electric models.
